# Fork of lpp-vita for BalatroPSVita
I, obviously, take no credit for this amazing interpreter developed by Rinnegatamante for the PSVita. 
I am making some changes and corrections to lpp-vita so it can execute my version of a port of Balatro to the PSVita ([which you can check out here](https://github.com/theMachineHandler/BalatroPSVita)).
All changes will be fully available for you to check right here, free and open source, as they should be. 
You can download the eboot.bin from the releases section or compile yourself using the VITASDK toolchain (the Makefile is already included in the project).
